# Newtonian Particle Simulation (Godot)

## 🔍 Overview
This is a 2D Newtonian particle simulation built in Godot using **Explicit Euler integration**.  
The simulation allows you to **adjust physical parameters** of the world and individual particles, and to **spawn or “shoot” particles** into the simulation.  
The project is designed for experimenting with **physics, simulation, and Godot scripting**.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Godot Engine (2D)  
- GDScript  
- Explicit Euler integration  
- Physics simulation (forces, motion, collisions)  

## Features
- Adjustable **mass, velocity, and forces** of individual particles  
- Ability to spawn or “shoot” particles into the world  
- Real-time simulation of particle interactions  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the project in Godot  
2. Start the main scene (`F5`)  
3. Adjust parameters in the UI and add particles by click-and-dragging the mouse
